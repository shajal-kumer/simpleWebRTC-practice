# SimpleWebRTC Demo

To get started, you will first need to edit `src/index.js` to set your API key.

See the section marked `IMPORTANT SETUP`, and change the value of the `API_KEY` constant to the API key you were provided.

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Once the server is running, go to [https://localhost:1234?room=pick-a-room-name](https://localhost:1234?room=pick-a-room-name).
